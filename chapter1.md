## The np.random module and Bernoulli trials

You can think of a Bernoulli trial as a flip of a possibly biased coin. Specifically, each coin flip has a probability $p$ of landing heads (success) and probability $1-p$ of landing tails (failure). To make it concrete in our finance example, let $p$ be the probability that a home buyer will pay off the loan (success). In this exercise, you will write a function to perform a Bernoulli trail, `bernoulli_trial(p)`, which returns `True` for a success. To do this, use the `np.random.rand()` function, which returns a random number between zero and one.  Run this function 100,000 times for `p = 0.95` to check to see if you get the number of successes you expect.

*** =instructions
- Seed the random number generator
- Write the function `bernoulli_trial(p)`. Within this function:
    * Choose a random number between zero and one.
    * If the number you chose is less than `p`, return `True`.
    * Otherwise, return `False`.
- Initialize the counter of `True`s, which are Bernoulli trial successes (buyer pays off his or her mortgage), to zero.
- Write a `for` loop to count the number of successes in 100,000 trials with `p=0.95`.
- Count the fraction of trials that were successes.
- Print the result.
